# rsdtlib: Remote Sensing with Deep-Temporal Data Library

This project provides a Python module that allows:
1. Download remote sensing data directly from Sentinel Hub (i.e. Sentinel 1 & 2)
2. Temporally stack, assemble and tile these observations
3. Create windows of longer time series comprising these observations (i.e. deep-temporal)
